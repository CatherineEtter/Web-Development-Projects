This web app allows the user to decrypt and encrypt messages simply by typing them in the top input box.
The user can then select the key to specify how far the encryption algorithm "rotates" the original message.
The user may also specify if the output should be case-sensitive or not.
Any unicode can be inserted. However this app will only encrypt using the English alphabet.
